##  Webcomic &amp; Sequential Art CMS
The **Yosemite** Webcomic &amp; Sequential Art Content Management System
is currently in early development.

It is to be a Comicpress/Wordpress replacement,
and an alternative to external hosters such as Webtoon or Tapas.
It has been designed from scratch for sequential art,
with many more features and potential for scalability.

This repository contains both the frontend *(Tunnel View)*
as well as the backend *(Valley)*.
